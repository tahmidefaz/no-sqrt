# no-sqrt
Estimates the square root of a number without the sqrt() function. 
Uses binary search algorithm to find the root of a number.

## Explanation
We know that:


`if sqrt(x) = z, then x = z^2`

So, `if given x`, we need to find a number we need to find a number between 0 and x whose square is equal to x.
